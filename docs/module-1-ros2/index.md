# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics book. This module covers the fundamentals of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic systems.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

In this module, you'll learn:
- The core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- How to work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Practical implementation with rclpy Python integration
- Creating URDF humanoid robot descriptions

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand and implement the fundamental ROS 2 concepts including middleware, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes that communicate using topics
- Develop publishers and subscribers for message passing
- Work with services and actions for request-response communication
- Create basic URDF robot descriptions for humanoid robots
