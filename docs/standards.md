# Documentation Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for creating content in the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics book.

## Content Structure

All chapters must follow the mandatory 9-section template:
1. Introduction
2. Learning Outcomes
3. Conceptual Foundations
4. Technical Deep Dive
5. Practical Implementation
6. Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips
7. Industry Use Cases
8. Summary / Key Takeaways
9. Practice Tasks / Mini-Projects

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone and Style
- Academic, formal, explanatory, technical
- Mentor-to-student approach: respectful, direct, supportive
- Accessible language without being condescending
- Clear explanations of complex concepts

### Technical Accuracy
- All content must reflect current industry standards
- Robotics concepts must align with ROS2, URDF, and real control systems
- Agentic AI content must reflect current production practices
- Code examples must be verified to run successfully in specified environments

### Educational Clarity
- Content must be structured from beginner to advanced levels
- All concepts must be explained with practical examples and hands-on exercises
- Each chapter should build upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts systematically

## Code Examples

### Requirements
- All code examples must be reproducible
- Include proper setup instructions for different environments
- Provide expected outputs or behavior
- Include dependencies needed for execution

### Format
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Include comments explaining complex sections
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Ensure examples are self-contained where possible

## Error Handling

### Documentation Errors
- Clearly mark deprecated content
- Provide alternatives for outdated approaches
- Include version information where relevant
- Link to updated resources when available

### Implementation Errors
- Document common error scenarios
- Provide troubleshooting steps
- Include error message explanations
- Suggest debugging strategies

## Accessibility

- Use descriptive headings and subheadings
- Include alt text for images and diagrams
- Provide text alternatives for visual content
- Ensure content is navigable by screen readers

## Citations and References

- Include proper citations to official documentation
- Reference research papers or credible industry sources
- Use consistent citation format
- Verify all external links are valid
