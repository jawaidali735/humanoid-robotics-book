# AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Clarity (Beginner to Advanced)
Content must be structured to guide learners from beginner to advanced levels with clear progression paths. All concepts must be explained with practical examples and hands-on exercises. Each chapter should build upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts systematically.

### Technical Accuracy
All technical content must reflect current industry standards and best practices. Robotics concepts must align with ROS2, URDF, and real control systems. Agentic AI content must reflect current production practices. Code examples must be verified to run successfully in the specified environments.

### Practical Outcomes
Every technical module must include hands-on examples that readers can execute. At least one working demo must be provided (simulation acceptable). Content should emphasize practical applications and real-world implementations over theoretical concepts alone.

### Ethical Responsibility
All AI and robotics content must include safety considerations and responsible AI practices. Content creators must address potential ethical implications of humanoid robotics and AI systems. Safety notes must accompany all technical modules involving physical systems.

### Original and Traceable Content
All content must be original with proper citations to official documentation or reputable research sources. Code examples must be source-traceable and verifiable. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and all external sources must be properly attributed.

### Mentor-to-Student Tone
The communication style must be respectful, direct, and supportive. Content should adopt a mentoring approach that guides students through complex topics. Language should be accessible without being condescending, with clear explanations of complex concepts.

## Standards and Structure
Content must adhere to strict quality standards to ensure educational effectiveness. Each chapter must start from a specification that defines clear objectives, prerequisites, and expected outcomes. The book must include examples, step-by-step procedures, and final exercises for each major topic. Every technical module must specify inputs, outputs, architecture, implementation details, failure modes, and safety notes.

Minimum total length requirement: 20,000-35,000 words. All images and figures must include proper attribution and be appropriately licensed for educational use.

## Development Workflow
Each chapter follows a specification-driven development approach where requirements are clearly defined before content creation begins. The Docusaurus platform is used for documentation with GitHub Pages for deployment. Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code serve as primary development tools to ensure consistency and quality. All content undergoes peer review and technical validation before publication.

## Governance
This constitution serves as the governing document for all project activities. All contributors must adhere to the principles outlined herein. Any amendments to this constitution require explicit approval and must be documented with clear rationale. Compliance with these principles is mandatory for all project participants.

Content creation follows the specification → plan → tasks workflow as defined by Spec-Kit Plus. All changes must maintain consistency with established educational goals and technical standards.
