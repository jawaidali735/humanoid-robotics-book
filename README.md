# Book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This project implements a comprehensive book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, following the 9-section template format and focusing on practical implementation with ROS 2, simulation environments, and AI integration.

## Project Status

The book content is complete with comprehensive coverage of:
- Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Module 2: Simulation Environments (Gazebo & Unity)
- Module 3: AI Integration (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Capstone Project: Voice-Controlled Autonomous Humanoid System
- Additional Resources: Hardware requirements and safety guidelines

Module 4 (Vision-Language-Action) was intentionally skipped as per project requirements.

## Content Overview

The book is organized into several modules, each following a consistent 9-section structure:
1. Introduction
2. Learning Outcomes
3. Conceptual Foundations
4. Technical Deep Dive
5. Practical Implementation
6. Common Pitfalls and Solutions
7. Industry Use Cases
8. Summary and Key Takeaways
9. Practice Tasks
